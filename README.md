# Downloads Folder Cleaner

The **Downloads Folder Cleaner** is a simple Python app designed to organize and clean up your Downloads folder by identifying and moving files based on their extensions to designated folders. It helps keep your Downloads folder clutter-free and well-organized.

## Features
- **File Extension Filtering**: Automatically identifies files by their extensions (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`).
- **Customizable Destination Folders**: Move files to specific folders such as Documents, Pictures, or any custom directory.
- **Error Handling**: Handles missing files, permission issues, and other errors gracefully.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## How It Works
The app scans your Downloads folder, filters files based on their extensions, and moves them to predefined locations. For example:
- `.txt` files are moved to the **Documents** folder.
- `.jpg` and `.png` files are moved to the **Pictures** folder.
- Other file types can be added as needed.
